🎓 AI-Based Student Performance & Dropout Prediction System

An intelligent Machine Learning–based academic analytics system designed to predict student performance and identify at-risk students using academic and behavioral indicators.
This system helps teachers take early preventive actions through data-driven insights.

🚀 Project Overview

This project uses Machine Learning classification models to analyze student data such as attendance, exam marks, and assignments.
It predicts whether a student is likely to PASS or is AT RISK, and provides performance levels and improvement recommendations.

The system includes:

🔐 Secure Teacher Login

👤 Single Student Prediction

📂 Batch Prediction using CSV files

📊 Advanced Graphical Analysis

📈 Statistical Insights & Reports

🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Both models are trained and evaluated, and the system automatically selects the best-performing model based on accuracy.

📂 Features
🔐 Secure Teacher Login

Passwords are stored using hashing

Limited login attempts for security

👤 Single Student Prediction
